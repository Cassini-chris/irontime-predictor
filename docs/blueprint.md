## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated blue (#3F51B5) to evoke the energy and focus of competition.

- Use minimalist icons representing swimming, biking, and running to visually enhance the input fields and results display.
- A clean, futuristic layout with distinct sections for input, calculation, and results. Use white space to create visual separation and a sense of calm.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the prediction process.
